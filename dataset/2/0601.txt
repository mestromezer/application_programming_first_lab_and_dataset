The Second Time We Met



I liked the first few pages of the book. And then I cringed so much. I expected a cute read about two people getting their second chance. But, unfortunately, I received a poorly-written story with characters who don't act like real people. I wasn't invested in this story at all, because after the first chapter or so we just get a mentioning of Cara and Henry meeting for the second time and starting dating after that. Like just why? Why would you do that to readers? I wanted to read myself about how they met, started talking to each other, began catching feelings, and so on. The Second Time We Met is an awkward and predictable story and I didn't care about those characters even for one second.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with this arc in exchange for an honestâ€¦
