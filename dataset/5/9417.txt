Кто мы такие? Гены, наше тело, общество



I think this book is really captivating and informative. Earlier, I've read Stephen Pinker's 'The Blank Slate' where he proves the pivotal role of genes in human life and behaviour. Here, Sapolsky tries to show the importance of another basic category - the environment. And his humorous and competent narration could be the great proof of the fantastic difficulty of the human brain and behaviour.
