Сварить медведя



Absolutely fascinating and astonishing novel. It is more than just a detective story. You will be an immediate witness in all events and feel author's love to his nation and Nordic lands. The novel has been interspersed with deep and nontrivial questions and remarks that make the book philosophical as well.
