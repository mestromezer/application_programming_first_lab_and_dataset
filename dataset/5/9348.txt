Похвала Глупости



This book can be divided into two parts. The first part is much more theoretical and rhetorical in its analysis of stupidity as a pervasive element of human life. The second one is more accusatory. Erasmus criticizes the life of the Catholic Church and the people of his epoch. As for me, the first part is more intriguing than the second.
