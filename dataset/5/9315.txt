Воскресение



'Voskreseniye'/'Resurrection' is the third romance of Leo Tolstoy where he reflects on eternal issues of human relationships both in small groups and in the whole country. The acute feeling of injustice and inequality makes him create his own idea of personal resurrection through moral transfiguration. Many religious monologues make the novel the representation of Tolstoy's spiritual philosophy. That seems to be his New Testament.
