Разговор в "Соборе"



It is a marvellous novel with a specific view on life that is typical for Latin American writers. Vargas Llosa creates an enormous world of different people involved in a controversial political disturbance. He exposes the extreme situations in their lives to the reader's judgement with his personal sympathy for these humiliated people and hidden disdain for their offenders.
