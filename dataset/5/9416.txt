Энеида



It is the epic masterpiece of Vergil which became classical in the time of his life. Like Homer's 'Iliad' for Ancient Greece it was a fundamental historic poem for Ancient Rome. Vergil gives us the legend of the origin of the Roman Empire, Latin language, and civilization blessed by Olympic gods.
