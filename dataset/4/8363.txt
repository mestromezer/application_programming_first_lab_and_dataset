Древнегреческая религия



This is somewhat attractive writing on the religion of Ancient Greek. The author is famous for his inspirational style of argumentation and narration. However, he sometimes exaggerates the positive and essential features of Greek religion. Also, his anti-Semitic position makes his book much less objective.
