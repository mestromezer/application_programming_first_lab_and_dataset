The Do-Over



That's one of my favorite rom-coms now! I give this book 4.5 / 5 stars, because I just absolutely LOVED it.Perci (Persephone) Mayfield is at the dentist's office when she hears her boyfriend breaking up with her for some concert tickets. Then Perci sees her ex at her job, so she decides to quit. Now Perci doesn't have a boyfriend or job, so she makes some New Year's resolutions. But at the family gathering, Perci accidentally tells her parents that she's actually dating her neighbor, Nate. Yes, that's a fake dating trope, everyone!I enjoyed this book so much! Perci's a ray of sunshine, she's a little bit awkward, but at the same time, she can stand for herself. Her character development is one of the best parts of this book. The chemistry between Perci and Nate is just the chef's kiss.â€¦
