Маленькое Чудо



Unexpectedly moving novel of Modiano. The complex story of a young girl who got entangled in the web of past phantoms of her mother and childhood. As I read the novel, I thought that Modiano had been influenced by Sartre's "Nausea" and imagined that the story could be splendidly filmed by David Lynch or Lars von Trier.
